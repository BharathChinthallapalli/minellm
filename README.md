This repository contains experimental code for two main components:

- **advanced_prompt_tuning.py** – utility classes and helpers for advanced prompt tuning experiments.
- **privacy_ai_pipeline.py** – an example pipeline that combines secure data
  processing with prompt tuning.

The scripts are not fully featured but should run once the required
packages are installed. Use the provided `requirements.txt` to install the
dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Both scripts perform dependency checks and will print a helpful error
message if something important is missing.
